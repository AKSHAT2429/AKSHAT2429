## Academic Projects

* **Security and Privacy in Distributed Learning** 
    * Developed a novel distributed learning framework achieving 75% more efficiency. The framework leverages split learning and transfer learning, enabling training of the global model in a single communication round while preserving privacy.
    * Designed generative approach frameworks using GANs and Variational Autoencoders for both IID and Non-IID environments.
    * Outperformed existing methods such as Federated Learning in terms of bandwidth costs by 80%.

* **Credit Card Fraud Detection**
    * Addressed the imbalanced data employing SMOTE, ensuring a more robust and equitable dataset for analysis.
    * Developed and evaluated predictive models for credit card fraud detection using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and XGBoost.

* **Implementing Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch** 
    * Implemented algorithms include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression using L1 and L2 regularization, Maximum A-posteriori Algorithm, Maximum Likelihood Algorithm, K-means clustering, and Multi-class regression algorithms from scratch in Python.
